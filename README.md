### Problem

v0. Return the boolean value of "it is possible to leave the starting position and reach treasure."

### Recursive Abstraction

When asked to 

  return the boolean value of "it is possible to leave the starting position and reach treasure"
  
the recursive abstraction can 

  return the boolean value of "it is possible to leave the starting position moved by one unit and reach the treasure"
  
### Base Case

The starting position is the position which contains the treasure.

or

It is not possible to leave the starting position by one unit and reach the treasure.


### English/Pseudocode Description of Algorithm

Check if the starting position is the position which contains the treasure.
If not, invoke the recursive abstraction. {
- move one unit in the next possible cardinal direction 
- make the new position the new starting position
- invoke the recursive step 
}
